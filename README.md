# What?

I'm playing around with Activiti and Spring Boot.

I'm starting from this tutorial:
https://spring.io/blog/2015/03/08/getting-started-with-activiti-and-spring-boot

I might add some additional features or change things up a
bit as I go. Feel free to follow along.

# Development Log

## Initial Commit

I just wrote a README.

## Starter Project

I used Spring Initializr (https://start.spring.io/) to create a Gradle Project with H2 and Actuator built in, and specified the Maven repo coordinates and other metadata. I'm a big fan of this tool.

I've added the contents of my zip from Initializr to this commit.
